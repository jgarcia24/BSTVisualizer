# BSTVisualizer
Developed using C

• Devised a console-based binary search tree visualizer that allows the user to create their own tree structure and
visualize it after each iteration

• Allows users to search for and remove nodes, and outputs visualization to the console after each action

• Users can specify the height and the program will create an AVL tree of the desired height
